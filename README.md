# Apple appstore-analysis
#### Analyze apple app store data to provide market insights to potential stakeholders and give them answers to basic questions based of analysis, to enable them to make data driven decisions. 

We have taken a dataset from Kaggle to analyze the information on the apps available on the app store. 
This includes the apps name, the sizing (bytes), Ratings, supporting devices, Supported Languages, genres, rating count etc.

To get an idea of the app descriptions and what these apps do we have taken another dataset that stores all the app descriptions and gives us a lot of information about how the app interfaces with its users and how it could perform in the market.
